# Political Figure Recognition with MobileNetV2

This project harnesses the power of deep learning and face recognition specifically for identifying political figures. Using the MobileNetV2 model, this system can currently recognize 10 key faces in the political sphere, with flexibility to expand to additional figures as needed. It’s designed to deliver accurate, real-time recognition, making it ideal for applications like media analysis, historical archiving, and digital libraries focused on political contexts.

## How It Works
MobileNetV2, known for its efficiency and strong performance on image classification tasks, provides the backbone of this project. By focusing on a set of predefined classes (political figures), the model is optimized to identify faces with high accuracy while keeping computational costs low, making it accessible for real-world applications and adaptable for more extensive datasets.

## Features
- **Current Support for 10 Classes**: Recognizes 10 specific political figures.
- **Scalable**: Easily adaptable to recognize additional faces or switch contexts.
- **Optimized for Efficiency**: Leveraging MobileNetV2 allows for quick and accurate predictions.

## Why This Project?
Face recognition tailored to specific domains can be a powerful tool. By focusing on political figures, this project opens up unique applications for media and political research, creating a specialized recognition model that goes beyond general-purpose face recognition. This specificity makes it easier to manage datasets and streamline the training process, while still offering flexibility for future growth.
